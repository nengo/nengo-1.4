Communication channel
=====================

**Purpose**:
This demo shows how to construct a simple communication channel.

**Comments**:
A communication channel attempts
to take the information from one population
and put it in the next one.
The "transformation" is thus the identity :math:`f(x) = x`.

Notably, this is the simplest "neural circuit" in the demos.
This is because the connection
from the first to second population
is only connection weights
that are applied to postsynaptic currents (PSCs)
generated by incoming spikes.

**Usage**:
Grab the slider control and move it up and down
to see the effects of increasing or decreasing input.
Both populations should reflect the input,
but note that the second population
only gets input from the first population
through synaptic connections.
