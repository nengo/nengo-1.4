<title>JIV compatibility information</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>JIV compatibility information</h1>

&quot;JIV&quot; is a <em>Java&nbsp;1.1&nbsp;applet</em>.  It should
run on any Web browser or appletviewer that properly supports
Java&nbsp;1.1 (including AWT&nbsp;1.1), as per <a
href="http://java.sun.com/">Sun</a>'s reference specification.
The Java support, also known as &quot;Java Virtual Machine&quot; (JVM) or &quot;Java Runtime Environment&quot; (JRE), can be built-in the browser (for example, Netscape Navigator/Communicator version&nbsp;4.x, and Microsoft Internet Explorer), or can be provided by a browser plugin.  Java plugins can be upgraded/replaced independent of the browser.

<p> JIV is quite memory-hungry: every loaded 3D data volume requires
8-9Mb of memory. For faster interactive response, try to use a Java
implementation that has a &quot;just-in-time&quot;&nbsp;(JIT)
compiler.

<p> The following Java environments were tested and appear to work for
JIV:<br>
(<em>please contribute corrections and additions</em>)

<h3>Linux (i386)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><dl>
    <dt>IBM JDK for Linux, version&nbsp;1.1.8 (a port of Sun's JDK)
    <dd>Available at no-cost from IBM.
	<!-- former url, now dead: www.ibm.com/java/jdk/118/linux/ -->
	It uses a good JIT compiler, and is the fastest solution 
	for JIV on Linux. However, it may not work on some modern Linux distributions (in which case use the IBM Java 1.4.1 below).<br>
	You can download the JRE version from
	<a href="http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/~crisco/jiv/jre/">here</a>.
  </dl>
  <li><dl>
    <dt>IBM JRE or SDK for Linux, version&nbsp;1.4.1 (a good Linux port of Sun's SDK)
    <dd>Available at no-cost from 
	<a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/linux140/index.html">www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/linux140/index.html</a>.
	It uses a good JIT compiler.
  </dl>
  <li><dl>
    <dt> Netscape Navigator/Communicator 4.6-4.7 (built-in Java, but with no JIT compiler, hence slow).
    <dd>
  </dl>
  <li><dl>
    <dt>Sun JDK for Linux, version&nbsp;1.2.2 (&quot;Java2 SDK, standard edition&quot;)
    <dd><!-- http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/ -->
  </dl>
  </ul>

<h3>SGI IRIX</h3>
<ul>
  <li><dl>
    <dt>SGI Java Development Environment 3.2 (a port of Sun's JDK
	1.1.8)
    <dd>Available at no-cost from
	<a href="http://www.sgi.com/products/evaluation/6.x_jdk_3.2/">www.sgi.com/products/evaluation/6.x_jdk_3.2/</a>.
	It has a JIT compiler, and is the recommended platform for
	IRIX 6.x. (SGI Java 3.1.1 also works, but it may be a bit slower)
  </dl>
  <li><dl>
    <dt>Netscape Navigator/Communicator 4.x (4.08 and later). Built-in Java, but with no JIT compiler.
    <dd><!-- do any of the sgi-customized versions have jit compilers?? -->
  </dl>
  <li><dl>
    <dt>SGI Java2 Software Development Kit v1.2.1 (a port of Sun's JDK 1.2.1) 
    <dd>It has a JIT compiler.
	<!-- http://www.sgi.com/Products/Evaluation/6.x_java2_1.2.1/ -->
  </dl>
</ul>
Several versions of SGI JDK, Java plugins and Netscape browsers are available from 
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/products/evaluation/">www.sgi.com/products/evaluation/</a>
(released versions), and
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/developers/devtools/languages/java.html">www.sgi.com/developers/devtools/languages/java.html</a>
(development/beta versions).
  
<h3>Windows 95/98/NT/2000/etc</h3>
<ul>
  <li><dl>
    <dt> Netscape Navigator/Communicator 4.6-4.7
    <dd> This uses a fast JIT compiler by Symantec.
  </dl>
  <li><dl>
    <dt> IBM JDK for Windows, version&nbsp;1.1.8 (a port of
	Sun's JDK)
    <dd> Available at no-cost from IBM.
      <!-- former url, now dead? "http://www.ibm.com/java/jdk/118/" -->
  </dl>
  <li><dl>
    <dt> Sun J2SDK for Windows, version&nbsp;1.4.2 
    <dd> (on WinXP)
  </dl>
  <li><dl>
    <dt> Microsoft Internet Explorer version&nbsp;4 and above, with
	Microsoft Java&nbsp;VM&nbsp;version&nbsp;5.0&nbsp;<em>build&nbsp;3167</em>
	(or later)
    <dd>(older Microsoft Java&nbsp;VM versions, which were shipped
	with IE4 and with some early IE5 versions, will <em>not</em> do!)
  </dl>
</ul>

<h3>MacOS (PowerPC)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><dl>
    <dt> Apple MRJ (Mac OS Runtime for Java) version&nbsp;2.2
    <dd> Available at no-cost from
	<a href="http://www.apple.com/java/">www.apple.com/java/</a>.
	It provides a JVM compatible with Sun's JDK&nbsp;1.1.8, 
	and can be used in two ways:
	<ul>
	  <li>by using the &quot;Applet Runner&quot; 
	      bundled with it.
	  <li>by configuring a web browser to use it (MRJ)
	      as its Java engine. Cooperating browsers include:
	      Sun's HotJava, iCab (available from
	      <a href="http://www.icab.de">www.icab.de</a>),
	      and Microsoft Internet Explorer version&nbsp;4 or later. 
	</ul>
  </dl>
  <li><dl>
    <dt> Netscape Navigator/Communicator will <em>not</em> do.
    <dd> (since it doesn't fully support Java AWT 1.1)
  </dl>
</ul>

<h3>...Other operating systems</h3>
<ul>
  <li><dl>
    <dt>Netscape Navigator/Communicator version&nbsp;4.x (4.06 or above).
    <dd>Available for a variety of platforms; it has built-in Java support.
  </dl>
  <li><dl>
  <dt>Sun's Java Runtime 1.1.x or later.
  <dd>May be available for your platform ... check out <a href="http://java.sun.com/">java.sun.com</a> 
      (versions not provided by Sun are
      listed in the &quot;ports&quot; section), or check with your operating system vendor.

  </dl>
</ul>
